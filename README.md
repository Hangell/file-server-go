# Basic HTTP Server to Share File Server with Authentication

This is a simple HTTP server written in Go that serves files from a specific directory and uses basic authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed (version 1.16 or higher)

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

## Code Structure

```cmd
/shared-files-server
‚îÇ   auth.go
‚îÇ   go.mod
‚îÇ   go.sum
‚îÇ   main.go
‚îÇ   README.md
‚îÇ   server.go
```
- `auth.go`: Contains the authentication logic. The `Secret` function validates user credentials, and `NewAuthenticator` creates a new BasicAuthenticator.
- `main.go`: The entry point of the program. It processes command-line arguments, creates the authenticator, and starts the server.
- `server.go`: Contains the server logic. The `StartServer` function configures and starts the HTTP server.


## Usage

Compile and run the server with the following command:

```sh
go run main.go <directory> <port>
```

- `<directory>`: The directory you want to serve.
- `<port>`: The port on which the server will run.

### Example

To serve the `public` directory on port `9000`, run:

```sh
go run main.go public 9000
```

## Authentication

This server uses basic authentication to protect access to the served files. The default credentials are:

- User: `admin` | `dev` | `user`
- Password: `teste`

### How to Change the Credentials

To change the credentials, you will need to modify the `Secret` function in the source code (`auth.go`). The `Secret` function is responsible for returning the password hash for a given user. The password hash can be generated using [this tool](https://unix4lyfe.org/crypt/).

### Secret Function

The `Secret` function checks the user and returns the corresponding password hash. In the provided example:

```go
func Secret(user, realm string) string {
    if user == "admin" || user == "dev" || user == "user" {
        return "$1$/q9tTBog$KtdXn0eQTpiUP9g//xLaS1" //https://unix4lyfe.org/crypt/ MD5 Crypt: md5 salt
    }
    return ""
}
```

If you want to add more users or change the password, generate a new hash and replace the value in the `Secret` function.

## Dependencies

This project uses the `go-http-auth` package for authentication management. Make sure to install the dependencies with the command:

```sh
go get -u github.com/abbot/go-http-auth
```

## Log

The server will log the port it is running on and any errors that occur during execution.
